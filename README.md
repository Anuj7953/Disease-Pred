🩺 Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning

📌 Overview

This project is a Machine Learning-based Disease Prediction System that predicts whether a person is likely to have a particular disease based on various health-related input features.
It uses Logistic Regression as the primary model and compares its performance with other ML models for better accuracy.

🚀 Features

✅ Predicts disease likelihood based on health parameters
✅ Uses Logistic Regression for classification
✅ Includes data preprocessing & feature scaling
✅ Displays accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix
✅ Simple web-ready code structure for future deployment
